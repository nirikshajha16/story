It was a raining outside which I didn't notice up until I opened my window to let that tiny irritating fly out of my room. It was just a drizzle but it felt as if it was only going to get bigger which it did and became the cause of a lot of turning points in a lot of people's lives in the following days but I'll get to that later.
I opened the cupboard to pull out the black jumpsuit which I never got the chance to wear since I bought it and I sighed in relief saying "finally!".
