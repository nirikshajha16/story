My friends and I were working on a project which I didn't even completely understand to be honest. Sometimes I feel so left out among them just because they seem to be so much more confident than me or maybe they are just very good at concealing the fact that they are just as confused and clueless as me. Anyways, so the project was not going great and I had decided to spend the whole day working it out but my gut made me make a choice which I later should come to regret or not is up to you to decide.
