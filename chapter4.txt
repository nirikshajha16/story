I was frantic searching for the red umbrella cause my black umbrella on my black jumpsuit would've made me look like I just walked out of a funeral which is not a very good vibe I guess so my search for the red umbrella went on for almost half an hour until I found it behind the curtain. Well, maybe this day won't be so bad, I thought to myself as I looked in the mirror. I didn't want to wear my nice shoes though because it was a hell of a mess out there on the streets.
